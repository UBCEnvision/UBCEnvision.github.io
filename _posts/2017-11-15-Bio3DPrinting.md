### Printing life's building blocks.
The University of British Columbia and the award-winning bioprinting company Aspect Biosystems successfully co-organized the first “Printing the Future of Therapeutics in 3D” International Research Roundtable. This event showcased the reasearch and development of global leaders in tissue engineering research and pharmaceutical industry experts. It also provided a space to discuss the rapidly emerging and potentially game-changing technology of 3D-printing living human tissues (bioprinting). Topics ranged from investigating the feasibility of printing stem cells, the implementation of bioprinting in the drug delivery to the ethical issues of 3D bioprinting. The discussion culminated in a panel discussion at the Telus Science World, where visitors could ask questions to the presenting panel in between presentations.
