### What's Brewing in Minneapolis?
Thanos, Siang, Josh and Shams represented UBC Envision at the 2017 AIChE Student Meeting in Minneapolis. Their workshop on IoT for automated beer brewing went really well, with a large room full of excited students interested in learning more about setting up their own brewing project in their AIChE chapters.
