### Taking Off The Training Wheels
After learning everything they could from their mentors, the junior team accompanyed the senior team to Oregon State University for the 2017 AIChE Regional Chem-E-Car competition. The rookies did very well for their first race and received silver for their poster, falling short to only the senior UBC team.
