headline: Future-proof agriculture
description: We are a diverse team of students from across different engineering disciplines. With a shared passion for innovation and technology, we hope to contribute to the future of agriculture, in transitioning from human labour to full automation.

box: >
  As the world population grows, climate change continues and reliable human labour becomes increasingly expensive, we must find more efficient and sustainable ways to grow food and sustain ourselves. The UBC AgroBot team will be building a fully autonomous robot capable of analyzing its environment and performing targeted weeding, fertilizing and soil analysis though the use of advanced robotics, image recognition and machine learning.

# The Challenge

## agBOT @ Purdue University
This project will be competing in the agBot challenge at the Purdue University, Indiana. This competition attracts many teams from companies and universities across North America. The objectives of the compeition are to create an autonomous machine capable of navigating a corn field to identify the corn crop and weeds. Upon identification of the corn plant, the machine should determine if the plant is healthy or in distress that requires fertilizer be applied by the machine. Upon identification of a weed, the machine should eradicate the weed chemically and/or mechanically. The competition will be judged by reputable members of the agricultural technology industry, such as The Climate Corporation (Monsanto), and Blue River Technology.

## Getting Involved
We are looking for highly self motivated individuals who are ready to take on this challenging yet rewarding project. This new team provides a start-up like environment and multidisciplinary projects give you the best hands-on and learning experience to tackle any engineering problems. Members of the team will be assigned to highly collaborative projects in two major categories which are robotics and automation. In small groups, members in these projects will get the full experience from researching, sourcing materials, prototyping and constructing a working product. Robotics projects will focus on the mechanical and electrical aspects of the robot such as chassis design. The automation projects will be more software-oriented such as developing an image recognition system and the user interface.
