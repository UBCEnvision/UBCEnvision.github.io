headline: Maximizing Potential of Microalgae
description: Biofuels are fuels derived from biological sources; their renewable nature makes them a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Since the 1950s, algae has been commercially cultivated (mainly for pharmaceutical products) and  recently gained attention as a potential biofuel source. However, due to the price of production, it creates a big limitation for the utilization of algae biofuels. Join us as we work to offset the production cost of algae biofuels by combining algae growth with wastewater treatment and simultaneously extracting carbohydrates and lipids to produce two different types of biofuels.

  The algae project began at UBC in 2016 as a research project, which focused on the design of a cost-efficient photobioreactor using bioluminescent algae strains. Since the summer of 2017, the focus shifted to the growth and extraction processes; we wanted to combine the different uses of microalgae to maximize production. Algae is one of many feedstocks used to produce biofuels from biomass, as well as a medium used for wastewater treatment to reduce the nitrogen content in secondary effluents. Currently, two types of biofuels can be extracted from algae; biodiesel and bioethanol. Cytosolic lipid bodies contain substantial amounts of triacylglycerides (TAG), which can then be processed into biodiesel via transesterification. Monomeric sugars from carbohydrates can be fermented into bioethanol. Our project aims to combine all three usages of microalgae (reduction of nitrogen content in wastewater, production of biodiesel, and production of bioethanol) into one process. This way, we offset the production cost of algae biofuels by maximizing the products.

# Subteams

## Growth
The growth team is responsible for cultivating microalgae using different growth conditions. Their objective is to optimize the lipid and sugar content in the cells. Members formulate the growth medium and isolate the grown microalgae for extraction usage.

## Extraction
The extraction team is responsible for converting the microalgae into biofuels. Their objective is to optimize the biofuel yield. Members separate the lipids and sugars from the cultivated cells and process both into biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively.

## Monitoring
The monitoring team is responsible for monitoring the microalgae culture conditions to determine the optimal time for cultivation. Members will create a system that collects data from the growth cultures.

## Impact Analysis
The impact analysis is a new addition to the project; it will be responsible for analyzing the sustainability of algal biofuels. This team works closely with the projects undertaken by the Growth and Extraction Teams. Using relevant research literature and Life Cycle Assessments,  they will work towards ensuring that the projects have minimal adverse effects on the environment.
