headline: Design Build and Compete
description: To design a car that can only be powered by chemical reactions. The process of creating the car involves building a power system (batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors etc), selecting a stopping mechanism reaction, designing the circuitry, coding microcontrollers and assembling the mechanical components and car body.

  UBC Chem-E-Car is a design team under the UBC Chemical & Biological Engineering Department that competes in the annual AIChE (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) Regional and National Chem-E-Car Competitions. The goal of the competition is to build a shoebox sized car that carries a given load of water within a given amount of distance. Chem-E-Car provides the opportunity for UBC engineering students to learn valuable technical and interpersonal skills.

# Technology

## Mechanical Team
Designs and develops the body and other mechanical components of the car. The car is
custom built, made of 3D printed components and various other purchased materials; the car
and all its parts must fit inside a 40cm x 30cm x 20cm box and be able to carry an extra load of
water ranging from 0-500 mL. The design team must incorporate and organize the reactor,
power source, microcontrollers and wiring onto the car, as well as ensure its stability and ability
to travel in a straight line.


## Lab Team
Designs a chemical-based stopping mechanism for the car. The chemical reaction’s rate of
completion is used to stop the car motor. The lab teams must design a precise and accurate
reaction, calibration curve and equation that will calculate the concentrations or quantity of
reagents that will result in the completion of the reaction at the required time

## Power Source Team
Builds an energy source (battery, fuel cell, combustion engine) to power the motor, and hence
the propulsion of the car. The energy sources must provide a consistent output of energy and
be able to be constructed at the day of the competition. It must also be heavily tested in varying
conditions to ensure successful operation for competition day.

## Circuitry Team
Codes the car to respond to the stopping mechanism and programmes the motor to run the car.
Design the sensor system which is responsible for reacting to the changes in the chemical
reaction which would eventually stop the car. The sensitivity and exactness of the sensor
system impacts how accurately the calibration curve is applied to stop the car as it covers a
specified distance.

# Our Future
UBC Chem-E-Car aims to go to and win National and International AIChE Chem-E-Car
Competitions. We strive to design innovative timing mechanisms and power sources, and a
unique car every year. Envision also plans for Chem-E-Car to integrate Flow Cell team’s and
Algae team’s projects into its designs.
