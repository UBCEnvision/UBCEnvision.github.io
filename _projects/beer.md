headline: Automated Brewing
description: Do you enjoy beer? What about process control, thermodynamics and kinetic modelling? Controlling this biological process to achieve the desired beer characteristics is challenging to this day. Large breweries have access to sophisticated devices for process control, but what about homebrewers and craft breweries who can’t spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on high-end equipment? BioT makes efforts to design and implement low-cost data monitoring and have our innovative techniques and advanced technology be applied to actual breweries to brew the perfect beer through various projects.

    The Automated Beer Brewing system is a project encompassed by the student organization UBC Envision. The project is based on the idea of ‘The Internet of Things’, and BioT aims to develop craft brewing technologies and to create an automated brewing system with the ability to monitor and control process variables such as temperature, acidity, gravity and possibly more in real-time. The team also pays attention to engineering multidisciplinary student development through practical applications while creating a meaningful and relevant product. The team will conduct the brewing process, collect data in the fermentation phase, provide quality control on the finished product, as well as analyze and model the data using an online web server. The students are able to apply what they learned in their classes, work on their teamwork skills while preparing their technical skills for industry.
    
    BioT’s short term goals are to develop our members' knowledge on the brewing world and establish an appreciation of how directly the brewing process relates to concepts learned in class. Our long term goals are to implement a small scale brewing laboratory that can operate autonomously and allow for simple, low cost data collection on an 'internet of things' basis. This data collection is going to be used to develop models and data clusters, to establish consistency within brew quality and eventually create and incorporate new brewing technologies into our bench scale setup. 

    Through various projects, BioT’s long-goal is to optimize brewing processes for brewing technologies, to design and implement low-cost data monitoring, and in time, to have our research and technology introduced and applied to actual breweries to brew the perfect beer. The sub-team's learning goals will differ throughout the teams,although all sub-teams are working towards the same short and long term goals.

# Subteams

## Brewing Team
The brewing team is responsible for designing the brews, maintaining the equipment, and brewing the beer. Everything must run smoothly for efficiency and the good quality of the product, as this process gets very complicated. The team uses the theory taught in CHBE courses (such as CHBE 220/221) to develop a bench scale brewery, develop methods to optimize the brewing process by analyzing products and intermediates during fermentation and create new recipes through research and determine the conditions needed for consistent product quality. 

For the brewing team, the objective is to simulate a project in industry and to introduce fluid transfer, real pumps, electronics, and unit operations. These are essential for any chemical or mechanical engineer when working in industry

## Instrumentation Team
The instrumentation team is responsible for programming temperature, pH, CO2, density and dissolved oxygen sensors to collect the data during the fermentation. The team also builds and designs analytical equipment to monitor and control the brewing process variables and builds upon a web app that allows a user to see key fermentation parameters in real-time and warn users about outliers.

The instrumentation team will have goals more specific to electrical/computer and chemical engineering in the process control area. This means that they must understand how the programming/process control interface works, essential process control theory, and data collection through probes. 


## Laboratory Team
The lab team is responsible for testing the final product for quality control as a simulation of real world quality control processes. The team creates data clusters to develop models for brewing process data and uses laboratory equipment to test properties beyond the instrumentation team’s abilities. 

The laboratory team is specific to anyone with interest in data analysis and it has the goal of improving students’ computational method and statistics skills through real data utilization. They will also focus on developing lab procedures, creating and updating Standard Operating Procedures and ensuring that the product is on par, or better with BC's standard for fermented beverages.
