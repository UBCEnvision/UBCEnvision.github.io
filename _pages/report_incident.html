	<h2>Incident Reporting</h2>
	<p>
		Fill out the Google form below to report a loss incident. The main goal behind near loss reporting is to document all those incidents in a systematic manner, 
		make sure that the team learns from their mistakes and minimize the risk of similar incidents happening in the future. A loss incident can be anything from a safety incident or near miss to
		an incident that resulted in lost time or finances. This could include the finance team not submitting a report on time and missed the PAF application deadline; resulting in the team losing funding for that year, or
		the mech team ordering the wrong equipment or supplies; resulting in delays in project completion and wasting resources.
	</p> 
	
	<h2>What is a <b>near miss?</b></h2>
	<p>
		A <i>near miss</i> is an unplanned event that did not result in injury, 
		illness, or damage â€“ but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of events prevented an 
		injury, fatality or damage; in other words, a miss that was nonetheless very near.
