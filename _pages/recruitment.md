## Apply to Envision

<!--Envision-->

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/envision.png" width="55%" left="50%" alt="envisionlogo"></div>

<!--
Because Envision is a student chapter under the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), we require new applicants to either **apply for AIChE student membership** or **renew their existing AIChE student membership for 2019** before applying for Envision membership. It only takes a few minutes to sign up and it's FREE! Registration to be part of Envision teams is now open! You can find the links to the applications below. Please note that you must also apply for Envision if you plan on joining our projects.
-->

Envision, as the UBC chapter of AIChE, does not require applications for membership. Envision events are open for all UBC students and the general public to join, and we encourage you to sign up as an AIChE Member to take full advantage of professional networking and academic enrichment opportunities!

  Do you have a passion for the Chemical Arts? More importantly, do you like beer? UBC Envision BioT is recruiting now for all sub-teams: brewing, instrumentation and laboratory teams.

  Our focus is to develop craft brewing technologies and to create an automated brewing system with the ability to monitor and control process variables such as temperature and acidity in real-time. We make efforts to design and implement low-cost data monitoring and have our innovative techniques and advanced technology be applied to actual breweries to brew the perfect beer through various projects.

  Established in the summer of 2017, Green Joule focuses on the growth and extraction processes of algae biofuels; we wanted to combine the different uses of microalgae to maximize production, instead of purely focusing on one deliverable of the algae cell. The project hopes to recruit fellow enthusiastic parties (such yourself, reader) to help grow the scope and ambition of the team. Currently, we have our sights set on perfecting our process in the lab while looking to incorporate genetic modification into the mix in the hopes of making the biofuel yields more abundant. Who knows where you might take the team?
