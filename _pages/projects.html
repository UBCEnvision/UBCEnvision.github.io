		<h2>UBC Chem-E-Car</h2>
		<h3><a href = 'https://www.ubcchemecar.com/'>Check out the <u>Chem-E-Car website</u> for latest information!</a></h3>
		<p class="major">Our <b>flagship project</b>, where it all started.</p>
		<p>We represent UBC in the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Chem-E-Car competition where we compete with other North American and international teams.</p>
		<p>We design, build and test a shoe-box sized car from scratch every year. The process involves building a power system (batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors etc), selecting a stopping mechanism reaction, designing the circuitry, coding microcontrollers and assembling the mechanical components and car body.</p>

		<h2>BioT</h2>
		<p class="major">An engineering approach to good beer.</p>
		<p>Do you enjoy beer? (Of course you do) Fermentation started in the Bronze Age and is theorized to be the main driver behind the origin of civilization!</p>
		<p>Brewing is often treated as an art rather than a science, even though this biological process is quintessentially chemical engineering. Can you help us change that? One of our goals is to build an automated brewing system on campus that can be accurately controlled to produce a desired beer style!</p>

		<h2>Green Joule</h2>
		<p class="major">Maximizing Potential of Microalgae.</p>
		<p>Biofuels are fuels derived from biological sources; their renewable nature makes them a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Since the 1950s, algae has been commercially cultivated (mainly for pharmaceutical products) and recently gained attention as a potential biofuel source. However, due to the price of production, it creates a big limitation for the utilization of algae biofuels. Join us as we work to offset the production cost of algae biofuels by combining algae growth with wastewater treatment and simultaneously extracting carbohydrates and lipids to produce two different types of biofuels.</p>

		<h2>Cosmetic Research and Innovation Team</h2>
		<p class="major">Investigating cosmetic formulations</p>
		<p>Your skin is your largest organ, so you better take care of it! UBC CRIT investigates the principles of cosmetic formulations and how they interact with the skin at the molecular level. From working with common ingredients such as Vitamin C to lesser-known ingredients such as Bakuchiol, we take a hands-on approach to learn why they are so widely researched in the cosmetic industry. Join 2 skincare-obsessed co-captains and pick up some tips on how to take care of your skin along the way! We focus on progress, not perfection :)</p>

		<h2>Flow-Assisted Batteries</h2>
		<p class="major">Energy storage for the future.</p>
		<p>Renewable energy sources like wind and solar provide power output that depends largely on environmental conditions. Efficient, affordable energy storage systems are essential for the viability of renewable energy. Join us as we work on an ambitious, multi-disciplinary project in the design and construction of a sustainable microgrid system on campus using rechargeable redox flow batteries.</p>

		<h2>AgroBot</h2>
		<p class="major">Future-proof agriculture</p>
		<p>Agriculture and farming were synonymous so long as farming was not commercialized. But as the process of economic development accelerated, many other occupations allied to farming came to be recognized as a part of Agriculture. At present, agriculture besides farming includes forestry, fruit cultivation, dairy, poultry, mushroom, bee keeping, arbitrary, etc. Today, agriculture is looking for ways to keep up with the exponential rise in human population, and with that the increasing need for one of the most basic human need: Food. AgroBot hopes to tackle this challenge head on.</p>
