  Stephenie is a third-year chemical engineering student hoping to work in the skincare industry. She is very passionate about skincare quality, affordability, and sustainability and loves giving recommendations to others to help them along their skincare journey. Outside of school, Stephenie is a skincare addict who spends too much money on skincare and an athlete who plays badminton and ultimate frisbee (she used to compete in both sports!). She can also be found napping in broad daylight and running it down in League of Legends (she will single-handedly lose you a game).
