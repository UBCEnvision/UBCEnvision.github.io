 Alan Vilchis is currently a third-year student on a Combined Honors Program in Physics and Astronomy from the University of British Columbia. Before joining UBC Envision, he had experience working in the logistics sector, implementing a cloud-based WMS with a Mexican company. Getting involved in projects beyond his area of specialization has really sparked an interest to be involved in multi-disciplinary projects as a way of growing both personally and professionally.
