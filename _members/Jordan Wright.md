biography: >
 Jordan is a 3rd year Chemical & Biological Engineering student who returned to UBC Envision in 2017 from a year-long co-op term in Alberta. After the successes of the Chem-E-Car team in 2015, Jordan's interest in battery project work grew into a passion for sustainable development and student collaboration. Armed with newfound technical skills and a knack for mentorship, Jordan hopes to foster interest and long-term growth in the Canadian green energy market. Jordan, like Sal Khan, is vocal about his belief that anyone can learn anything and, by extension, make a positive impact on the world.
