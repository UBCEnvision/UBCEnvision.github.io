biography: Caitlin started off on the Chem-E Car team three years ago, while giving advice to our Envision family when needed. Not only is she capable of whipping up 3D parts using SolidWorks in 2 seconds or styling a chassis in 3, she can also dance her way into the American Ballet Theatre (her friends swear she can).
