biography: Caitlin is a 3rd year chemical engineering student. She started off on the Chem-E Car team three years ago and is currently focusing on her 3rd year courses, while giving advice to our Envision family when needed. Not only is she capable of whipping up 3D parts using SolidWorks in 2 seconds or styling a chassis in 3, she can also dance her way into the American Ballet Theatre (her friends swear she can).
