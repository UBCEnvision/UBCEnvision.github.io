biography: > 
  Nhi is a third-year Chemical Engineering student. She is a member of the brewing team on the Automated Beer Brewing project due to her interest in the field of food processing and production. She hopes to gain some hands on experience during this project and to apply chemical engineering theory in the project’s practical setting. Nhi is currently experimenting with brewing a prototype batch of Kombucha, a fermented tea, to see if the beer brewing technology being developed could also be applied to Kombucha home brews.
