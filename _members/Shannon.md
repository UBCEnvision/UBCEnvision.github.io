biography: > 
  Shannon McInnes is a graduate student in the Masters of Engineering (M.Eng) Mechatronics Design program at UBC with a background in biomedical and clinical engineering. With a passion for instrumentation and design and a love of beer, it was only natural that she join the CHBeer team and work to help improve the brewing process through the integration of sensor systems. Shannonâ€™s work this term has been focussed on the hardware setup and configuration of the temperature sensors and pH sensor using system on a chip (SoC) technology. Her favourite aspect of the CHBeer team is the opportunity to work collaboratively with the other sub-teams to create something everyone can enjoy, a good beer.
