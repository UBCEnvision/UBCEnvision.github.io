biography: > 
  Shannon McInnes is a graduate student in the Masters of Engineering (M.Eng) Mechatronics Design program at UBC with a background in biomedical and clinical engineering. With a passion for instrumentation and design and a love of beer, it was only natural that she join the CHBeer team and work to help improve the brewing process through the integration of sensor systems. Shannon’s work this term has been focussed on the hardware setup and configuration of the temperature sensors and pH sensor using system on a chip (SoC) technology. Her favourite aspect of the CHBeer team is the opportunity to work collaboratively with the other sub-teams to create something everyone can enjoy, a good beer.
