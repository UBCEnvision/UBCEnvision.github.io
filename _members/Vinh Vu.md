biography: >
  Vinh Vu is a third year student in the Biochemistry program at UBC. Having a deep interest in how chemical ingredients work with the skin, he wanted to help create an opportunity that would bring exposure about the cosmetic industry to students all around. As a member under UBC CRIT, he is interested in tackling problems with known chemical stability and transdermal delivery systems. Apart from the chemical side of cosmetic ingredients, Vinh is an avid skincare lover who just likes to indulge in some nice self-care time. While not studying, he can be found playing games or hiking downtown to some great restaurants.
