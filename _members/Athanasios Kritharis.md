  Athanasios (Thanos) Kritharis is a Masters student in Biological & Chemical Engineering. After 3 years of leading the Chem-E-Car Engineering design team and growing it into the multi-project group, Envision. He decided to step-down in his final year of studies to co-found Innovation Onboard.

Thanos strongly believes in the ability of students to make a difference in the world and is committed to empowering them to make these changes.
