### Kicking off the Algae Project
While the seniors were presenting on existing research, the juniors needed to find something to compete with. They decided to present on the viability of using algal biofuels, comparing them with fossil fuels and other renewable fuels, as well as comparing the methods used to produce algae. Although they didn't win the poster competition, they were able to connect with organizers to get a spot in the Generate 2017 conference.
