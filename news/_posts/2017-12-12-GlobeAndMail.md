### Globe and Mail Visits CHBeer
On December 12th Globe and Mail reporter Ian Bailey and photographer Darryl Dyck visited the CHBeer team to learn a bit about the project. 

We gave Ian an idea how our system works and the different types of testing that our team carries out in the lab such as a sedimentation test (stay posted for a blog post coming out in January). Furthermore we talked about what it is like to be an student in an engineering design team and why we believe being a part of a design team is a quintessential part of our education. 

The CHBeer team is extremely excited and honored for this opportunity and would like to thank UBC Public Affairs for arranging this with the Globe and Mail. 

Keep an eye out for the article which will be published in the Globe and Mail sometime over Christmas.
