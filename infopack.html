          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>We are inherently problem-solvers, and in news there are many problems that have moved from being an abstract, happening in some far away country, to problems we experience and face that have shaped how we live, and will shape how we will live. By being an engineering design team, we had the support to branch out from our flagship ChemE Car project to an array of 4 total projects that foster the engineering mindset, even at the design team level.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h5><b>UBC ChemE Car</b></h5>Envision started with ChemE Car and we are not about to forget our roots. ChemE Car is an annual competition that is held by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and tasks us with delivering a payload of random weight a random distance on our car, both of which are not told to us until right before the competition. Caveat: The car can only be powered and stopped using chemical reactions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h5><b>Automated Beer Brewing</b></h5>Envision’s beer brewing is built from the ground up because we aim to “teach” a microcontroller brew recipes through machine learning. We collect data from our brews and feed them back into our circuits, flagging correct and wrong parameters. This will help breweries, commercial and home brewers alike, increase the efficiency of their processes since the machine has been bred all throughout the various iterations of the brew to recognize and control the right parameters, instead of needing extra coding done at the end of the process. 
</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h5><b>Flow Cell Battery</b></h5>The flow cell project aims to investigate the viability of using flow-assisted zinc-nickel hydroxide batteries as a form of energy storage. The flowing electrolyte in a flow cell makes it more energy efficient and last longer. Moreover, normal batteries have more harmful metals (e.g. lead-acid batteries). Our cell uses potassium hydroxide and zinc oxide solutions which are non-toxic. With the flow cell, we want to vary combinations of the cell's parameters - flow regime, cell geometry, electrode shape, and others, in order to optimize the cell's performance and, eventually, build a microgrid of flow cells on campus.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h5><b>Algae Biofuels</b></h5>The algae project aims to test the feasibility, optimum growing and extracting condition for combining algal wastewater treatment with nutrient removal for biofuel production. Currently, two types of biofuels can be extracted from algae; cytosolic lipid bodies contain large amounts of triacylglycerides (TAG), which can be processed into biodiesel via transesterification, and monomeric sugars can be fermented into bioethanol. The project will involve attempts to extract lipids and/or sugars from microalgae used in wastewater treatment.</p>

            <p>Automated beer brewing project: Envision’s beer brewing is a bit different than commercial systems. We build ours from the ground up because instead of hard-coding a recipe into the machine, we aim to “teach” a microcontroller brew recipes through machine learning. We regularly brew (hooray!) in order to collect relevant data and send it off to an online database to get cleaned up, before using existing machine learning libraries to feed them back into our circuits. This will help breweries, commercial and home brewers alike, increase the efficiency of their processes since the machine has been bred all throughout the various iterations of the brew to recognize and control the right parameters, instead of needing extra coding done at the end of the process. </p>

            <p>The flow cell project at UBC Envision aims to investigate the viability of using flow-assisted zinc-nickel hydroxide batteries as a form of energy storage. It's basically a rechargeable battery, but has a few added benefits. Normal batteries' electrolytes don't move within the battery. With a flowing electrolyte, the energy efficiency of the battery is improved, extending the battery life. Moreover, normal batteries have more harmful metals (e.g. lead-acid batteries). Our cell uses KOH and ZnO dissolved in water - a non-toxic solution that isn't as bad when disposed of. However, these flow batteries involve dendritic zinc growth on the cathode, which can cause internal shorts (come to the info session for more explanation!). With the flow cell, we want to vary combinations of the cell's parameters - flow regime, cell geometry, electrode shape, and others, in order to optimize the cell's performance and, eventually, build a microgrid of flow cells on campus.  </p>
