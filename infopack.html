            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envision's projects give members a gateway into techniques and applications used in industry, such as CAD modelling, prototyping designs, lab experimentation and computer science. Moreover, projects give students the satisfication of seeing skills they learn come to fruition as the projects they are involved in grow from an idea to a physical and innovative solution to their initial problem. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bench-to-trench approach gives all our members a head start on industry standards of design and testing, ensuring a wealth of applicable skills in the workplace. Lastly, due to the various industries our designs can be applied to, you can build connections with industry professionals through networking at conferences and competitions, opening up future careers opportunities for you.</p>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In current news, many problems have moved from being an abstract, happening in another country, to problems we experience and face everday, shaping how we live and will live. At Envision, we are helping solve these problems.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h4><b>UBC ChemE Car</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envision started with ChemE Car and we are not about to forget our roots. ChemE Car is an annual competition that is held by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and tasks us with delivering a payload of random weight a random distance on our car, both of which are not told to us until right before the competition. Caveat: The car can only be powered and stopped using chemical reactions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h4><b>Automated Beer Brewing</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envision’s beer brewing is built from the ground up because we aim to “teach” a microcontroller brew recipes through machine learning. We collect data from our brews and feed them back into our circuits, flagging correct and wrong parameters. This will help breweries, commercial and home brewers alike, increase the efficiency of their processes since the machine has been bred all throughout the various iterations of the brew to recognize and control the right parameters, instead of needing extra coding done at the end of the process. 
</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h4><b>Flow Cell Battery</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow cell project aims to investigate the viability of using flow-assisted zinc-nickel hydroxide batteries as a form of energy storage. The flowing electrolyte in a flow cell makes it more energy efficient and last longer. Moreover, normal batteries have more harmful metals (e.g. lead-acid batteries). Our cell uses potassium hydroxide and zinc oxide solutions which are non-toxic. With the flow cell, we want to vary combinations of the cell's parameters - flow regime, cell geometry, electrode shape, and others, in order to optimize the cell's performance and, eventually, build a microgrid of flow cells on campus.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"><h4><b>Algae Biofuels</b></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The algae project aims to test the feasibility, optimum growing and extracting condition for combining algal wastewater treatment with nutrient removal for biofuel production. Currently, two types of biofuels can be extracted from algae; cytosolic lipid bodies contain large amounts of triacylglycerides (TAG), which can be processed into biodiesel via transesterification, and monomeric sugars can be fermented into bioethanol. The project will involve attempts to extract lipids and/or sugars from microalgae used in wastewater treatment.</p>

            1. First thing’s first, you need to sign up for our mailing list to receive updates, and apply for an interview with our online form (Links below).
            </p>

            <p>
            2.  We split our interviews into two parts: an individual and a group portion.
            </p>

            <p>
              a.  In the individual portion, behavioural questions (e.g. what challenges have you faced in your academic career?)  will be asked, allowing us to get to know your personality.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. In the group portion, you will be randomly put into groups of 6-8, and we will ask you a question, which would have been sent to you 3 days beforehand. We ask that the group discuss the question amongst themselves until they agree on a single answer. Cooperation, mutual understanding and critical thinking are tested in this part of the interview.
            </p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will contact you with an interview package through email. In the interview package will be your time slot and date, location and a question. This question will be asked during the group interview session. Sending it beforehand allows everyone to ponder and come up with compelling and valid reasons to support their points.
            </p>

            <p>
            3.  Wait for our response!
            We hope to get back to everyone 1 week after their respective interview times.
            </p>
