### Presenting sustainable energy solutions.
On November 27th, members of the flow cell team and algae team in Envision attended CleanEnergyBC's Generate conference, to compete in the student poster competition. The conference focuses on clean energy sloutions and ideas, and gives opportunities for students to showcase their work to the clean energy industry. 

Jordan, Shams, Shirley, and Taij from the flow cell team won the undergraduate competition along with a $500 prize. Their poster describes the benefits of their particular flow cell compared to other battery options, such as its use of cheap and abundant materials, high capacity, and recyclability. The algae team poster presented their approach on simultaneously extracting lipids and carbohydrates using ionic liquids extraction, as well as the potential for combining wastewater treatment with biofuels production.

We met numerous professionals in hydro-electrical technologies and environmental consulting. It was a great opportunity for outreach and networking, and we plan to go next year.
