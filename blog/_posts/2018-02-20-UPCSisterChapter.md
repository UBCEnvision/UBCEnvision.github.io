### Hola, amigos!
We are happy to announce that we are officially AIChE Sister Chapters with the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://bcn-aiche.upc.edu/en/about-us "UPC AIChE Student Chapter")! 

UPC's AIChE chapter members were our gracious hosts during the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering in Barcelona back in 2016. During our short stay in their beautiful city, not only have they shared with us the innovative research conducted by their department, but also the places to be when the sun sets in Barcelona (Siang, our advisor, took a huge liking to this). We have become close friends ever since. 

Subsequently, we found common interests through our respective Chem-E-Car and Beer Brewing projects, not to mention giving back to our respective student bodies. Both parties chose to keep in contact and build a mutually beneficial relationship by growing both chapter's projects with potential for international exposure for both chapters.

We are excited to what the future holds for both our chapters and what we can accomplish by working together. Stay tuned on both our social media platforms!
