On March 19th and 20th, UBC hosted the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC). MURC is an annual conference for UBC undergraduate students to showcase their research in front of their fellow UBC students, family, and friends. 

The BIOT lab team, consisting of Patsakorn,  Alice, Sasha , and Peerakij, participated in the conference to share the status of their glow-in-the-dark beer project. The project seeks to engineer brewerâ€™s yeast to overproduce a fluorescent vitamin, riboflavin.

The team is planning on transitioning into the lab and implementing the project during the summer. Once the modified yeast has been created, small-scale brews will be performed to determine the level of riboflavin production, as well as to inform optimization of taste and fluorescence. They are excited to see the results of this project!
