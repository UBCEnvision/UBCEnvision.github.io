With 2018 ahead, we at Envision are taking time to look back at our achievements and give thanks for the support from our university, our sponsors and our brilliant team members for helping us achieve a spectacular inaugural year for the organization. 

Achievements by Envision’s teams in 2017 include:

- [***1st and 2cd place in Chem E Car poster competition***]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url news/posts/2017-04-24-JuniorRegionals %})
	- 2017 Regional Chem E Car competition - Chem E Car team
- [***1st place in Chem E Quiz***]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /news/posts/2017-10-01-Barcelona %})
	- 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering - Chem E Car Team

	- Simon Fraser University - Algae Biofuel Team

From redefining how chemical engineering is taught using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to optimizing the growth of algae using wastewater and genetic engineering, from integrating the [Internet-Of-Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) with the brewing process to building a microgrid of batteries with 3 times the charge capacity, inspired by our continuous work of building sustainable power sources for our Chem E Car. Increasing external interest in our work has also led to us presenting at numerous outreach programs in 2017:

- 21st International Conference on Engineering Deisgn (ICED) 

- Chemical and Biological Engineering (CHBE) Open House

- CHBE Engineering Research Day
	- Best Presentation (Beer Brewing Automation Project)
- Vancouver Mini Maker Faire at the PNE

- UBC Applied Science Open House for prospective UBC Engineering students

- UBC Imagine Day exhibition for first year students

- UBC Jump Start - Engineering Design Team Introduction and Project Showcase

With our fearless approach to engineering problems, we not only have we given our members a chance to learn industry standard design and lab practices, we contributed back to academia and some teams are already working towards full collaboration with industry partners to apply their developing technologies. 

To the Daniel Family Foundation funding the Chem E Car team, to UBC Chemical and Biological Engineering and our sponsors, thank you for giving us the chance to learn what it means to engineer, to innovate. If it weren't for your contributions, our university education would not be as rich and fulfilling. To all our members at Envision, we could not have done what we did without your hard work and patience. To everyone else watching us and trying to envision what we would do next:

*We hope you are watching closely.*
