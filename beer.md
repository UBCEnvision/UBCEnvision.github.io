description: Do you enjoy beer? What about process control, thermodynamics and kinetic modelling? Fermentation started in the Bronze Age and is theorized to be the main driver behind the origin of civilization! However, controlling this biological process to achieve the desired beer characteristics challenging to this day. Large breweries have access to sophisticated devices for process control, but what about homebrewers and craft breweries who can’t spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on high-end equipment? This workshop will demonstrate how to build a low-cost device that can monitor and control key process variables such as temperature and pH during the brewing process. Through the Internet of Things, it is possible to access and monitor process variables from anywhere! Come join us and learn how to make great beer from the comfort of your phone.

The Automated Beer Brewing system is a project encompassed by the student organization UBC Envision. The project is based on the idea of ‘The Internet of Things’, and aims to develop craft brewing technologies and to create an automated brewing system with the ability to monitor and control process variables such as temperature and acidity in real-time. 

We are currently coupling sensors to web servers and developing a mobile app, which would allow operators to remotely view brewing conditions and key control variables. A large focus of our project is the concept that many home-breweries or smaller breweries lack the hundreds of thousands of dollars required for high-end equipment. 

Through our project, our long-goal is to optimize brewing processes for brewing technologies, to design and implement low-cost data monitoring, and in time, to have our machine learning algorithms be applied to actual breweries to brew the perfect beer.
